However, to date, studies on protective immunity have been performed only in animal models and correlates of protection have not been established in humans. Here, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on a fishing vessel associated with a high attack rate. Predeparture serological and viral reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) testing along with repeat testing after return to shore was available for 120 of the 122 persons on board over a median follow-up of 32.5\,days (range, 18.8 to 50.5\,days). A total of 104 individuals had an RT-PCR-positive viral test with a cycle threshold (CT ) of {$<$}35 or seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an attack rate on board of 85.2\% (104/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing of 39 viral genomes suggested that the outbreak originated largely from a single viral clade. Only three crew members tested seropositive prior to the boat's departure in initial serological screening and also had neutralizing and spike-reactive antibodies in follow-up assays. None of the crew members with neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence of bona fide viral infection or experienced any symptoms during the viral outbreak. Therefore, the presence of neutralizing antibodies from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against reinfection (Fisher's exact test, P\,=\,0.002).},

Mechanisms that can enable multiple viral genomes to be transported en bloc among hosts has only recently been gaining attention. A growing body of research suggests that extracellular vesicles (EV) are highly prevalent and robust vehicles for en bloc delivery of viral particles and naked infectious genomes among organisms.

Years later, children are presenting with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). To investigate the features of established MeV neuronal infections, viral sequences were analyzed from brain tissue samples of a single SSPE case and compared with MIBE sequences previously obtained from patients infected during the same epidemic. Both the SSPE and the MIBE viruses had amino acid substitutions in the ectodomain of the F protein that confer enhanced fusion properties. Functional analysis of the fusion complexes confirmed that both MIBE and SSPE F protein mutations promoted fusion with less dependence on interaction by the viral receptor-binding protein with known MeV receptors. While the SSPE F required the presence of a homotypic attachment protein, MeV H, in order to fuse, MIBE F did not. Both F proteins had decreased thermal stability compared to that of the corresponding wild-type F protein. Finally, recombinant viruses expressing MIBE or SSPE fusion complexes spread in the absence of known MeV receptors, with MIBE F-bearing viruses causing large syncytia in these cells. Our results suggest that alterations to the MeV fusion complex that promote fusion and cell-to-cell spread in the absence of known MeV receptors is a key property for infection of the brain., IMPORTANCE Measles virus can invade the central nervous system (CNS) and cause severe neurological complications, such as MIBE and SSPE.

These viruses were defective in virion production and expression of matrix (M) protein. The Niigata M protein-coding frame was interrupted by an in-frame termination codon, whereas the Yamagata M gene lacked the normal translational initiation codon. These mutations prevented translation of a normal M protein. However, RNA derived from the cloned Niigata and Yamagata M genes was translatable in vitro into low levels of aberrant proteins that reacted with M-specific antiserum. These proteins were also translated from poly(A)+ RNA from cells infected by Niigata and Yamagata virus strains. The aberrant M protein of Niigata virus was initiated at a downstream AUG codon created by a second mutation. The Yamagata M gene produced two aberrant proteins: one initiated mainly in vitro at an ACG codon, and a second species initiated at a downstream site both in vitro and in vivo. These results define the abnormal translational functions of the Niigata and Yamagata M genes, and further implicate the involvement of M protein defects in chronic central nervous system infections by measles virus.},

Recombinant viruses that contained envelope-associated genes from the Osaka-2 strain were generated on the IC323 wild-type MV background. The recombinant virus containing the M gene alone did not induce neurological disease, whereas the H gene partially contributed to neurovirulence. In sharp contrast, the recombinant virus containing the F gene alone induced lethal encephalopathy. This phenotype was related to the ability of the F protein to induce syncytium formation in Vero cells. Further study indicated that a single T461I substitution in the F protein was sufficient to transform the nonneuropathogenic wild-type MV into a lethal virus for hamsters.},

Also, it could be shown that the amounts of measles virus RNA in the brains differed from patient to patient and in the different regions investigated. In all patients, plus-strand RNAs specific for these five viral genes could be detected. However, the amounts of fusion and hemagglutinin mRNAs were low compared with the amounts in lytically infected cells. The presence of particular measles virus RNAs in SSPE-infected brains did not always correlate with mRNA activity. In in vitro translations, the matrix protein was produced in only one case, and the hemagglutinin protein was produced in none.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most severe sequela of measles virus infection is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a fatal disease of the central nervous system that generally develops 7-10 years after infection. From 1989 through 1991, a resurgence of measles occurred in the United States, with 55,622 cases of measles reported. The purpose of the present study was to identify cases of SSPE that were associated with the resurgence of measles and to calculate the risk of developing SSPE. METHODS: Brain tissue samples obtained from 11 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of SSPE were tested for the presence of measles virus RNA. Measles virus genotypes were determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by analysis of the sequences of the PCR products. A search of the literature was conducted to identify reports of cases of SSPE in persons residing in the United States who had measles during 1989-1991. RESULTS: The measles virus sequences derived from brain tissue samples obtained from 11 patients with SSPE confirmed the diagnosis of SSPE. For 5 of the 11 patients with SSPE who had samples tested by RT-PCR and for 7 patients with SSPE who were identified in published case reports, it was determined that the development of SSPE was associated with the measles resurgence that occurred in the United States during 1989-1991. The estimated risk of developing SSPE was 10-fold higher than the previous estimate reported for the United States in 1982. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against measles prevents more cases of SSPE than was originally estimated.},

However, experimentally measuring effects of mutations is challenging: we lack tractable lab assays for many SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and comprehensive deep mutational scanning has been applied to only two SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Here, we develop an approach that leverages millions of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences to estimate effects of mutations. We first calculate how many independent occurrences of each mutation are expected to be observed along the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny in the absence of selection. We then compare these expected observations to the actual observations to estimate the effect of each mutation. These estimates correlate well with deep mutational scanning measurements. For most genes, synonymous mutations are nearly neutral, stop-codon mutations are deleterious, and amino acid mutations have a range of effects. However, some viral accessory proteins are under little to no selection. We provide interactive visualizations of effects of mutations to all SARS-CoV-2 proteins (https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-mut-fitness/). The framework we describe is applicable to any virus for which the number of available sequences is sufficiently large that many independent occurrences of each neutral mutation are observed.},

  abstract = {Author summary RNA viruses generate diversity within individual, infected hosts. This genetic diversity can be used to trace how viruses evolve during the course of infection within individuals, and transmission between them. To investigate how SARS-CoV-2 diversity is generated and propagated, we deep sequenced 133 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from acutely infected individuals in Wisconsin. We capitalize on a large dataset of consensus genomes from Wisconsin to investigate how variants are transmitted within the surrounding community, and use a unique household dataset to estimate the number of viruses that are transmitted between epidemiologically linked individuals. We find that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by limited within-host diversity, and that the vast majority of intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) are lost during transmission. We do not find evidence that variation is frequently propagated along phylogenetically linked infections, and estimate that most infections are founded by very few unique virions. The combination of limited within-host diversity and tight transmission bottlenecks may slow the pace of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in the future, and suggests that extensive within-host evolution is likely rare. The emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages has raised concern that novel variants eliciting immune escape or the ability to displace circulating lineages could emerge within individual hosts. Though growing evidence suggests that novel variants arise during prolonged infections, most infections are acute. Understanding how efficiently variants emerge and transmit among acutely-infected hosts is therefore critical for predicting the pace of long-term SARS-CoV-2 evolution. To characterize how within-host diversity is generated and propagated, we combine extensive laboratory and bioinformatic controls with metrics of within- and between-host diversity to 133 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from acutely-infected individuals. We find that within-host diversity is low and transmission bottlenecks are narrow, with very few viruses founding most infections. Within-host variants are rarely transmitted, even among individuals within the same household, and are rarely detected along phylogenetically linked infections in the broader community. These findings suggest that most variation generated within-host is lost during transmission.},

  abstract = {Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a slowly progressing fatal human disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is associated with measles virus persistence. Virus nucleocapsids are present in the brain and the patient is in a state of hyperimmunization towards this agent. However, although all other structural polypeptides are recognized by the immune system, there is a markedly decreased antibody response towards virus matrix or membrane protein. Matrix protein has not been detected in brain cells and infectious virus is not present. The absence of this virus structural polypeptide is thought to account for the apparent restriction in virus maturation both in vivo and in vitro. SSPE viruses can only rarely be rescued from brain tissue by co-cultivation or cell fusion techniques using tissue culture cell lines susceptible to measles virus infection. Often this procedure fails to yield a lytic budding virus but produces instead a carrier cell line in which the agent is cell associated. These lines (known as SSPE cell lines) also do not contain matrix protein. However, the reason for this deficiency is unknown. We have therefore now examined an SSPE cell line which does not yield infectious virus in order to define this process further. We found that although messenger RNA for membrane protein was present, it was unable to form normal matrix protein in translation reactions.},

These viruses are often defective in the matrix (M) protein and always seem to have an altered fusion protein cytoplasmic tail. We reconstituted a cell-free, infectious M-less MV (MV-DeltaM) from cDNA. In comparison with standard MV, MV-DeltaM was considerably more efficient at inducing cell-to-cell fusion but virus titres were reduced approximately 250-fold. In MV-DeltaM-induced syncytia the ribonucleocapsids and glycoproteins largely lost co-localization, confirming the role of M protein as the virus assembly organizer. Genetically modified mice were inoculated with MV-DeltaM or with another highly fusogenic virus bearing glycoproteins with shortened cytoplasmic tails (MV-Delta(tails)). MV-DeltaM and MV-Delta(tails) lost acute pathogenicity but penetrated more deeply into the brain parenchyma than standard MV. We suggest that enhanced cell fusion may also favour the propagation of mutated, assembly-defective MV in human brains.},

  abstract = {The cytoplasmic tail of the measles virus (MV) fusion (F) protein is often altered in viruses which spread through the brain of patients suffering from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). We transferred the coding regions of F tails from SSPE viruses in an MV genomic cDNA. Similarly, we constructed and transferred mutated tail-encoding regions of the other viral glycoprotein hemagglutinin (H) gene. From the mutated genomic cDNAs, we achieved rescue of viruses that harbor different alterations of the F tail, deletions in the membrane-distal half of the H tail, and combinations of these mutations. Viruses with alterations in any of the tails spread rapidly through the monolayer via enhanced cell-cell fusion. Double-tail mutants had even higher fusion competence but slightly decreased infectivity. Analysis of the protein composition of released mutant viral particles indicated that the tails are necessary for accurate virus envelope assembly and suggested a direct F tail-matrix (M) protein interaction. Since even tail-altered glycoproteins colocalized with M protein in intracellular patches, additional interactions may exist. We conclude that in MV infections, including SSPE, the glycoprotein tails are involved not only in virus envelope assembly but also in the control of virus-induced cell fusion.},

Measles virus (MV) genomes replicating in SSPE brains do not give rise to budding particles and present various defects in gene expression, mostly concerning the matrix (M) protein. For one SSPE case (K), shown previously to be devoid of M protein expression, we examined here in detail the features involved in this defect. In the brain of patient K the normal, monocistronic MV M mRNA was completely substituted by a bicistronic RNA containing the coding sequence of the preceding phosphoprotein (P) gene in addition to the M coding sequence. Analysis of the P-M intercistronic region by direct cDNA sequencing showed that the consensus sequence at this RNA processing site was unaltered but revealed several distant point mutations. cDNA cloning and sequencing of the entire M coding region established that one of the point mutations leads to a stop codon at triplet 12 of the M reading frame. It is unknown whether this defect, explaining by itself the lack of M protein, is related also to the block of M mRNA formation. In addition we note that as much as 1\% of the nucleotides differed between two overlapping clones from the same brain. This high sequence variability could possibly account for the diversity of defects observed in MV gene expression in SSPE brains and may be a general phenomenon associated with RNA virus persistence.},

MV transcripts present in the brains of two SSPE patients and one MIBE patient were analyzed by quantitative Northern blots. In all three cases the transcripts from the first MV gene were relatively abundant, amounting to about one-tenth of that in lytically infected cells. However, the quantity of transcripts decreased sharply for each subsequent MV gene, arriving at 200-fold lower levels for the fifth MV gene. In comparison gradients of transcript levels are more shallow in either lytically or persistently infected cultured cells, where the transcripts of the fifth MV gene are only about five times less abundant than those of the first. These altered ratios of mRNAs appear to be typical for persistent MV brain infections and most likely lead to reduced expression of the viral envelope proteins, encoded by distal MV genes, at the surface of brain cells. This could account for the lack of viral budding and allow persistent MV infections to elude immune surveillance.},

The transcription of MV and of a defective MV derived from autopsy material of a SSPE case was studied in cultured cells. In the lytic infection the levels of the MV mRNAs decreased progressively with the distance of the six cognate genes from the 3' end of the genome, reflecting transcriptional attenuation at every gene junction. Transcripts covering two or three adjacent genes accounted for up to 20\% of single gene transcripts; incidentally the MV intergenic transcription signals were found to be less conserved than the analogous signals of other negative strand RNA viruses. Although the analysed SSPE-derived defective MV showed a localized transcription defect at the phosphoprotein--matrix gene junction (substitution of the mRNAs by readthrough transcripts), the corresponding intergenic 'consensus' sequence and the surrounding nucleotides were not altered. This implies that factor(s) involved in the transcription of this defective SSPE virus fail to recognize this particular signal sequence, a constellation which in this and other cases might be causally related to the development of MV persistence.},

One of these nucleotide substitutions and one deletion resulted in alteration of the reading frames of two fusion genes, as confirmed by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs. One cluster of mutations was exceptional; in the matrix gene of the MIBE case, 50\% of the U residues were changed to C, which might result from a highly biased copying event exclusively affecting this gene. We propose that the cluster of mutations in the MIBE case, and other combinations of mutations in other cases, favored propagation of MV infections in brain cells by conferring a selective advantage to the mutated genomes.},

  abstract = {Persistent measles viruses (MVs) causing lethal human brain diseases are defective, and the structure of several mutated matrix genes has been elucidated previously. The present study of four persistent MVs revealed a high number of differences from a consensus sequence also in other genes. Amino acid changes accumulated in the carboxyl terminus of the nucleocapsid protein and in the amino terminus of the phosphoprotein, but did not significantly alter these products, which are implicated in viral replication and transcription. The contrary is true for the envelope glycoproteins: In three of four cases, mutations caused partial deletion of the short intracellular domain of the fusion protein, most likely compromising efficient viral budding. Moreover, in the hemagglutinin gene of a strain showing strongly reduced hemadsorption, 20 clustered A to G mutations, resulting in 16 amino acid changes, were detected. This hypermutation might be due to unwinding modification of a part of the MV RNA genome accidentally present in a double-stranded form. Finally, we classified four lytic and seven persistent MV strains on the basis of their sequences. Surprisingly, the four lytic viruses considered belong to the same class. The persistent viruses form more loosely defined groups, which all differ from the vaccine strain Edmonston.},

MeV is dual-tropic: it replicates first in lymphatic tissue, causing immunosuppression, and then in epithelial cells of the upper airways, accounting for extremely efficient contagion. Efficient contagion is counter-intuitive because the enveloped MeV particles are large and relatively unstable. However, MeV particles can contain multiple genomes, which can code for proteins with different functional characteristics. These proteins can cooperate to promote virus spread in tissue culture, prompting the question of whether multi-genome MeV transmission may promote efficient MeV spread also in vivo. Consistent with this hypothesis, in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelia large genome populations spread rapidly through intercellular pores. In another line of research, it was shown that distinct lymphocytic-adapted and epithelial-adapted genome populations exist; cyclical adaptation studies indicate that suboptimal variants in one environment may constitute a low frequency reservoir for adaptation to the other environment. Altogether, these observations suggest that, in humans, MeV spread relies on en bloc genome transmission, and that genomic diversity is instrumental for rapid MeV dissemination within hosts.},

Herein, we compare the performance of four NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 WGS. Twenty-four clinical respiratory samples with a large scale of Ct values (from 10.7 to 33.9) were sequenced with four methods. Three used Illumina sequencing: an in-house metagenomic NGS (mNGS) protocol and two newly commercialised kits including a hybridisation capture method developed by Illumina (DNA Prep with Enrichment kit and Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel, RVOP), and an amplicon sequencing method developed by Paragon Genomics (CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 kit). We also evaluated the widely used amplicon sequencing protocol developed by ARTIC Network and combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. All four methods yielded near-complete genomes (\textquestiondown 99\%) for high viral loads samples (n = 8), with mNGS and RVOP producing the most complete genomes. For mid viral loads (Ct 20-25), amplicon-based enrichment methods led to genome coverage \textquestiondown 99 per cent for all samples while 1/8 sample sequenced with RVOP and 2/8 samples sequenced with mNGS had a genome coverage below 99 per cent. For low viral loads (Ct \textquestiondown = 25), amplicon-based enrichment methods were the most sensitive techniques. All methods were highly concordant in terms of identity in complete consensus sequence. Just one mismatch in three samples was observed in CleanPlex vs the other methods, due to the dedicated bioinformatics pipeline setting a high threshold to call SNP compared to reference sequence. Importantly, all methods correctly identified a newly observed 34nt-deletion in ORF6 but required specific bioinformatic validation for RVOP. Finally, as a major warning for targeted techniques, a loss of coverage in any given region of the genome should alert to a potential rearrangement or a SNP in primer-annealing or probe-hybridizing regions and would require further validation using unbiased metagenomic sequencing.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Quality control and preprocessing of FASTQ files are essential to providing clean data for downstream analysis. Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such as quality control, adapter trimming and quality filtering. These tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high-level programming languages (e.g. Python and Java) and provide limited multi-threading support. Reading and loading data multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient. RESULTS: We developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per-read quality pruning and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multi-threading support.

  abstract = {We describe a new computer program, SnpEff, for rapidly categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating \textasciitilde 356,660 candidate SNPs in \textasciitilde 117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of \textasciitilde 1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w(1118); iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that \textasciitilde 15,842 SNPs are synonymous and \textasciitilde 4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S \textasciitilde 0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3' UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory.},

We apply this platform to produce libraries of the Omicron BA.1 and Delta spikes. These libraries each contain {$\sim$}7,000 distinct amino acid mutations in the context of up to {$\sim$}135,000 unique mutation combinations. We use these libraries to map escape mutations from neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain, N-terminal domain, and S2 subunit of spike. Overall, this work establishes a high-throughput and safe approach to measure how {$\sim$}105 combinations of mutations affect antibody neutralization and spike-mediated infection. Notably, the platform described here can be extended to the entry proteins of many other viruses.},

  abstract = {The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak marks the first time that large amounts of genome sequence data have been generated and made publicly available in near real time. Early analyses of these data revealed low sequence variation, a finding that is consistent with a recently emerging outbreak, but which raises the question of whether such data are sufficiently informative for phylogenetic inferences of evolutionary rates and time scales. The phylodynamic threshold is a key concept that refers to the point in time at which sufficient molecular evolutionary change has accumulated in available genome samples to obtain robust phylodynamic estimates. For example, before the phylodynamic threshold is reached, genomic variation is so low that even large amounts of genome sequences may be insufficient to estimate the virus's evolutionary rate and the time scale of an outbreak. We collected genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from public databases at eight different points in time and conducted a range of tests of temporal signal to determine if and when the phylodynamic threshold was reached, and the range of inferences that could be reliably drawn from these data. Our results indicate that by 2 February 2020, estimates of evolutionary rates and time scales had become possible. Analyses of subsequent data sets, that included between 47 and 122 genomes, converged at an evolutionary rate of about 1.1 x 10(-3) subs/site/year and a time of origin of around late November 2019. Our study provides guidelines to assess the phylodynamic threshold and demonstrates that establishing this threshold constitutes a fundamental step for understanding the power and limitations of early data in outbreak genome surveillance.},

  abstract = {Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive, essentially untreatable, disease of the nervous system. When first described in the 20th Century, it was characterized more for its neuropathological features than for its pathophysiology or cause. It was not until the 1960s that a clear relationship to the measles virus was established. It is now thought that this uncommon infectious encephalopathy is caused by a "slow," altered or persistent form of the wild measles virus which has harbored in the nervous system for years. Then a "breakout" occurs and the more lytic and virulent organisms produce the progressive and spreading inflammatory and destructive lesions which are confined to the nervous system. Epidemiological study of the disease confirms its relationship to measles. In the years since the development of national measles immunization programs, there has been a dramatic decline in the incidence of measles exanthem and until recently a corresponding decline in the incidence of SSPE. In recent years there has been a mild to moderate increase in cases of SSPE as reported to the USA/International SSPE Registry. As yet, there has not been a totally effective treatment. The purpose of this paper is to give an overall review on SSPE and its relationship to measles. This review will include a prospectus of its history, considerations as to its etiology, correlation of clinicopathological features, and thoughts on the past and present epidemiology and treatment.},

However, standard phylogenetic tree reconstruction techniques do not account for the fact that bulk sequencing data measures mutations in a population of cells. We formulate and solve the multi-state perfect phylogeny mixture deconvolution problem of reconstructing a phylogenetic tree given mixtures of its leaves, under the~multi-state perfect phylogeny, or infinite alleles model. Our somatic phylogeny reconstruction using~combinatorial enumeration (SPRUCE) algorithm uses this model to construct phylogenetic trees jointly from single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy-number aberrations (CNAs). We show that SPRUCE addresses complexities in simultaneous analysis of SNVs and CNAs. In particular, there are often many possible phylogenetic trees consistent with the data, but the ambiguity decreases considerably with an increasing number of samples. These findings have implications for tumor sequencing strategies, suggest caution in drawing strong conclusions based on a single tree reconstruction, and explain difficulties faced by applying existing phylogenetic techniques to tumor sequencing data.},

Radiolabelling of cells carrying the Biken strain showed the production of an M protein with considerably altered immunoreactivity and a marked reduction in intracellular stability.

  abstract = {After the contagion measles virus (MV) crosses the respiratory epithelium within myeloid cells that express the primary receptor signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM), it replicates briskly in SLAM-expressing cells in lymphatic organs. Later, the infection spreads to epithelia expressing nectin-4, an adherens junction protein expressed preferentially in the trachea, but how it gets there is not understood. To characterize the mechanisms of spread, we infected groups of 5 or 6 cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) with either a wild-type MV or its ``N4-blind'' derivative, which is unable to enter nectin-4-expressing cells because of the targeted mutation of two hemagglutinin residues. As expected, both viruses caused similar levels of immunosuppression, as monitored by reductions in white blood cell counts and lymphocyte proliferation activity. However, monkeys infected with the N4-blind MV cleared infection more rapidly. Wild-type virus-infected monkeys secreted virus, while marginal virus titers were detected in tracheal lavage fluid cells of N4-blind MV-infected hosts. Analyses of tracheal rings obtained at necropsy (day 12) documented widespread infection of individual cells or small cell clusters in the subepithelial lamina propria of monkeys infected with either virus. However, only wild-type MV spread to the epithelium, forming numerous infectious centers comprised of many contiguous columnar cells. Infected CD11c+ myeloid (macrophage or dendritic) cells were frequently observed in the lamina propria below epithelial infectious centers. Thus, MV may use myeloid cells as vehicles not only immediately after contagion but also to infect epithelia of tissues expressing nectin-4, including the trachea.},

We find that internalized nectin-1-nectin-4 complexes follow the endocytic pathway. The nectin-1 cytoplasmic tail controls transfer: its deletion prevents trans-endocytosis, while its exchange with the nectin-4 tail reverses transfer direction. Nectin-1-expressing cells acquire dye-labeled cytoplasmic proteins synchronously with nectin-4, a process most active during cell adhesion. Some cytoplasmic cargo remains functional after transfer, as demonstrated with encapsidated genomes of measles virus (MeV). This virus uses nectin-4, but not nectin-1, as a receptor. Epithelial cells expressing nectin-4, but not those expressing another MeV receptor in its place, can transfer infection to nectin-1-expressing primary neurons. Thus, this newly discovered process can move cytoplasmic cargo, including infectious material, from epithelial cells to neurons. We name the process nectin-elicited cytoplasm transfer (NECT). NECT-related trans-endocytosis processes may be exploited by pathogens to extend tropism. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.},

  abstract = {Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a chronic encephalitis occurring after infection with measles virus. The prevalence of the disease varies depending on uptake of measles vaccination, with the virus disproportionally affecting regions with low vaccination rates. The physiopathology of the disease is not fully understood; however, there is evidence that it involves factors that favour humoral over cellular immune response against the virus. As a result, the virus is able to infect the neurons and to survive in a latent form for years. The clinical manifestations occur, on average, 6 years after measles virus infection. The onset of SSPE is insidious, and psychiatric manifestations are prominent. Subsequently, myoclonic seizures usually lead to a final stage of akinetic mutism. The diagnosis is clinical, supported by periodic complexes on electroencephalography, brain imaging suggestive of demyelination, and immunological evidence of measles infection. Management of the disease includes seizure control and avoidance of secondary complications associated with the progressive disability. Trials of treatment with interferon, ribavirin, and isoprinosine using different methodologies have reported beneficial results. However, the disease shows relentless progression; only 5\% of individuals with SSPE undergo spontaneous remission, with the remaining 95\% dying within 5 years of diagnosis.},

We have investigated replication of measles virus in brain tissue obtained after the onset of neurological disease and in the terminal phase. With a hybridization tomographic technique that combines in situ hybridization with macroradioautographic screening of large areas of tissue, we analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of virus genes in vivo, using region- and strand-specific probes for the nucleocapsid and matrix genes. We show that early in the course of SSPE there is a global repression in the synthesis and expression of the genome. In the final stage of SSPE most infected cells still have depressed levels of plus- and minus-strand viral RNA and contain nucleocapsid protein but lack matrix protein. These findings provide further evidence for a unified view of slow infections of the nervous system, where the general constraints on virus gene expression provide an explanation for persistence of virus in the face of the host's immune response, and the slow evolution of pathological change. In the final phases of SSPE the more specific block in virus replication accounts for the cell-associated state of the virus and the difficulty in virus isolation.},

No evidence was found for the existence of a large number of antigenically unique M proteins. In contrast to SSPE sera, other hyperimmune human or rabbit sera precipitated M protein as well as the other viral proteins. The results suggest that in patients with SSPE there is either diminished synthesis of M, or it is not recognized normally by the immune system, and that an abnormality in M protein is involved in the pathogenesis of SSPE. Although differences in electrophoretic mobility of the M proteins and several other viral proteins were observed among different SSPE and measles strains, there was no pattern characteristic of SSPE strains, nor could these strains be distinguished by peptide mapping.},

  abstract = {Measles virus (MeV) is the most contagious human virus. Unlike most respiratory viruses, MeV does not directly infect epithelial cells upon entry in a new host. MeV traverses the epithelium within immune cells that carry it to lymphatic organs where amplification occurs. Infected immune cells then synchronously deliver large amounts of virus to the airways. However, our understanding of MeV replication in airway epithelia is limited. To model it, we use well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE) from lung donors. In HAE, MeV spreads directly cell-to-cell forming infectious centers that grow for \textasciitilde 3-5 days, are stable for a few days, and then disappear. Transepithelial electrical resistance remains intact during the entire course of HAE infection, thus we hypothesized that MeV infectious centers may dislodge while epithelial function is preserved. After documenting by confocal microscopy that infectious centers progressively detach from HAE, we recovered apical washes and separated cell-associated from cell-free virus by centrifugation. Virus titers were about 10 times higher in the cell-associated fraction than in the supernatant. In dislodged infectious centers, ciliary beating persisted, and apoptotic markers were not readily detected, suggesting that they retain functional metabolism. Cell-associated MeV infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, which models the first stage of infection in a new host. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified wound healing, cell growth, and cell differentiation as biological processes relevant for infectious center dislodging. 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining located proliferating cells underneath infectious centers. Thus, cells located below infectious centers divide and differentiate to repair the dislodged infected epithelial patch. As an extension of these studies, we postulate that expulsion of infectious centers through coughing and sneezing could contribute to MeV's strikingly high reproductive number by allowing the virus to survive longer in the environment and by delivering a high infectious dose to the next host.},

  abstract = {Genome sequence data are of great value in describing evolutionary processes in viral populations. However, in such studies, the extent to which data accurately describes the viral population is a matter of importance. Multiple factors may influence the accuracy of a dataset, including the quantity and nature of the sample collected, and the subsequent steps in viral processing. To investigate this phenomenon, we sequenced replica datasets spanning a range of viruses, and in which the point at which samples were split was different in each case, from a dataset in which independent samples were collected from a single patient to another in which all processing steps up to sequencing were applied to a single sample before splitting the sample and sequencing each replicate. We conclude that neither a high read depth nor a high template number in a sample guarantee the precision of a dataset. Measures of consistency calculated from within a single biological sample may also be insufficient; distortion of the composition of a population by the experimental procedure or genuine within-host diversity between samples may each affect the results. Where it is possible, data from replicate samples should be collected to validate the consistency of short-read sequence data.},

  abstract = {Paramyxoviruses, including the human pathogen measles virus (MV), enter host cells by fusing their viral envelope with the target cell membrane. This fusion process is driven by the concerted actions of the two viral envelope glycoproteins, the receptor binding protein (hemagglutinin [H]) and the fusion (F) protein. H attaches to specific proteinaceous receptors on host cells; once the receptor engages, H activates F to directly mediate lipid bilayer fusion during entry. In a recent MV outbreak in South Africa, several HIV-positive people died of MV central nervous system (CNS) infection. We analyzed the virus sequences from these patients and found that specific intrahost evolution of the F protein had occurred and resulted in viruses that are ``CNS adapted.'' A mutation in F of the CNS-adapted virus (a leucine-to-tryptophan change present at position 454) allows it to promote fusion with less dependence on engagement of H by the two known wild-type (wt) MV cellular receptors. This F protein is activated independently of H or the receptor and has reduced thermal stability and increased fusion activity compared to those of the corresponding wt F. These functional effects are the result of the single L454W mutation in F. We hypothesize that in the absence of effective cellular immunity, such as HIV infection, MV variants bearing altered fusion machinery that enabled efficient spread in the CNS underwent positive selection., Measles virus has become a concern in the United States and Europe due to recent outbreaks and continues to be a significant global problem. While live immunization is available, there are no effective therapies or prophylactics to combat measles infection in unprotected people. Additionally, vaccination does not adequately protect immunocompromised people, who are vulnerable to the more severe CNS manifestations of disease. We found that strains isolated from patients with measles virus infection of the CNS have fusion properties different from those of strains previously isolated from patients without CNS involvement. Specifically, the viral entry machinery is more active and the virus can spread, even in the absence of H. Our findings are consistent with an intrahost evolution of the fusion machinery that leads to neuropathogenic MV variants.},

Therefore, early detection and identification of minority viral haplotypes may help to promptly adjust the patient's treatment plan preventing potential disease complications. Minority haplotypes can be identified using next-generation sequencing, but sequencing noise hinders accurate identification. The elimination of sequencing noise is a non-trivial task that still remains open. Here we propose CliqueSNV based on extracting pairs of statistically linked mutations from noisy reads. This effectively reduces sequencing noise and enables identifying minority haplotypes with the frequency below the sequencing error rate. We comparatively assess the performance of CliqueSNV using an in vitro mixture of nine haplotypes that were derived from the mutation profile of an existing HIV patient. We show that CliqueSNV can accurately assemble viral haplotypes with frequencies as low as 0.1\% and maintains consistent performance across short and long bases sequencing platforms.},

  abstract = {Cancer is a disease driven by genetic variation and mutation. Exome sequencing can be utilized for discovering these variants and mutations across hundreds of tumors. Here we present an analysis tool, VarScan 2, for the detection of somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) in exome data from tumor-normal pairs. Unlike most current approaches, our algorithm reads data from both samples simultaneously; a heuristic and statistical algorithm detects sequence variants and classifies them by somatic status (germline, somatic, or LOH); while a comparison of normalized read depth delineates relative copy number changes. We apply these methods to the analysis of exome sequence data from 151 high-grade ovarian tumors characterized as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We validated some 7790 somatic coding mutations, achieving 93\% sensitivity and 85\% precision for single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection. Exome-based CNA analysis identified 29 large-scale alterations and 619 focal events per tumor on average. As in our previous analysis of these data, we observed frequent amplification of oncogenes (e.g., CCNE1, MYC) and deletion of tumor suppressors (NF1, PTEN, and CDKN2A). We searched for additional recurrent focal CNAs using the correlation matrix diagonal segmentation (CMDS) algorithm, which identified 424 significant events affecting 582 genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate the robust performance of VarScan 2 for somatic mutation and CNA detection and shed new light on the landscape of genetic alterations in ovarian cancer.},

Based on studies of brain tissue from SSPE patients and our work with MV-infected NSE-CD46(+) mice, which express the measles receptor CD46 on neurons, several lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of viral spread in the central nervous system differs from that in nonneuronal cells. To examine this alternate mechanism of viral spread, as well as the basis for the loss of normal transmission mechanisms, infection and spread of MV Edmonston was evaluated in primary CD46(+) neurons from transgenic mice and differentiated human NT2 neurons. As expected, unlike that between fibroblasts, viral spread between neurons occurred in the absence of syncytium formation and with minimal extracellular virus. Electron microscopy analysis showed that viral budding did not occur from the neuronal surface, although nucleocapsids were present in the cytoplasm and aligned at the cell membrane. We observed many examples of nucleocapsids present in the neuronal processes and aligned at presynaptic neuronal membranes. Cocultures of CD46(+) and CD46(-) neurons showed that cell contact but not CD46 expression is required for MV spread between neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that the neuronal environment prevents the normal mechanisms of MV spread between neurons at the level of viral assembly but allows an alternate, CD46-independent mechanism of viral transmission, possibly through the synapse.},

  abstract = {Analysis of 772 complete severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from early in the Boston-area epidemic revealed numerous introductions of the virus, a small number of which led to most cases. The data revealed two superspreading events. One, in a skilled nursing facility, led to rapid transmission and significant mortality in this vulnerable population but little broader spread, whereas other introductions into the facility had little effect. The second, at an international business conference, produced sustained community transmission and was exported, resulting in extensive regional, national, and international spread. The two events also differed substantially in the genetic variation they generated, suggesting varying transmission dynamics in superspreading events. Our results show how genomic epidemiology can help to understand the link between individual clusters and wider community spread.},

  abstract = {The current model of measles virus (MV) pathogenesis implies that apical infection of airway epithelial cells precedes systemic spread. An alternative model suggests that primarily infected lymphatic cells carry MV to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, supporting MV shedding into the airway lumen and contagion. This model predicts that a mutant MV, unable to enter cells through the unidentified epithelial cell receptor (EpR), would remain virulent but not be shed. To test this model, we identified residues of the MV attachment protein sustaining EpR-mediated cell fusion. These nonpolar or uncharged polar residues defined an area located near the binding site of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM), the receptor for MV on lymphatic cells. We then generated an EpR-blind virus maintaining SLAM-dependent cell entry and inoculated rhesus monkeys intranasally. Hosts infected with the selectively EpR-blind MV developed rash and anorexia while averaging slightly lower viremia than hosts infected with wild-type MV but did not shed virus in the airways. The mechanism restricting shedding was characterized using primary well-differentiated human airway epithelial cells. Wild-type MV infected columnar epithelial cells bearing tight junctions only when applied basolaterally, while the EpR-blind virus did not infect these cells. Thus, EpR is probably a basolateral protein, and infection of the airway epithelium is not essential for systemic spread and virulence of MV.},

It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date.

  abstract = {The influenza virus polymerase is central to influenza virus evolution. Adaptive mutations within the polymerase are often a prerequisite for efficient spread of novel animal-derived viruses in human populations. The polymerase also determines fidelity, and therefore the rate at which the virus will acquire mutations that lead to host range expansion, drug resistance, or antigenic drift. Despite its importance to viral replication and evolution, our understanding of the mutational effects and associated constraints on the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is relatively limited. We performed deep mutational scanning of the A/WSN/1933(H1N1) PB1, generating a library of 95.4\% of amino acid substitutions at 757 sites. After accuracy filters, we were able to measure replicative fitness for 13,354 (84\%) of all possible amino acid substitutions, and 16 were validated by results from pairwise competition assays. Functional and structural constraints were better revealed by individual sites involved in RNA or protein interactions than by major subdomains defined by sequence conservation. Mutational tolerance, as defined by site entropy, was correlated with evolutionary potential, as captured by diversity in available H1N1 sequences. Of 29 beneficial sites, many have either been identified in the natural evolution of PB1 or shown experimentally to have important impacts on replication and adaptation. Accessibility of amino acid substitutions by single nucleotide mutation was a key factor in determining whether mutations appeared in natural PB1 evolution. Our work provides a comprehensive map of mutational effects on a viral RdRp and a valuable resource for subsequent studies of influenza replication and evolution.},

The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-CoV-2 with 100\% agreement across specimens. The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa, and Roche Cobas 6800 failed to detect positive specimens only near the limit of detection of our CDC-based LDT assay. All assays were 100\% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold standard.

In none of the brain material were all five structural proteins simultaneously detected. Nucleocapsid protein and phosphoprotein were found in every diseased brain area, whereas haemagglutinin (H) protein was detected in two, fusion (F) protein in three and M protein only in one SSPE case. In two cases, variations in the occurrence of H and F proteins could be observed between regions displaying different degrees of neuropathological changes. No correlation was observed between the humoral immune response and the immunohistological findings.

However, the process by which MeV infection is efficiently established in the respiratory tract is controversial with suggestions that respiratory epithelial cells are not susceptible to infection from the apical mucosal surface. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that infection is initiated in lung macrophages or dendritic cells and that epithelial infection is subsequently established through the basolateral surface by infected lymphocytes. To better understand the process of respiratory tract initiation of MeV infection, primary differentiated respiratory epithelial cell cultures were established from rhesus macaque tracheal and nasal tissues. Infection of these cultures with MeV from the apical surface was more efficient than from the basolateral surface with shedding of viable MeV-producing multinucleated giant cell (MGC) syncytia from the surface. Despite presence of MGCs and infectious virus in supernatant fluids after apical infection, infected cells were not detected in the adherent epithelial sheet and transepithelial electrical resistance was maintained. After infection from the basolateral surface, epithelial damage and large clusters of MeV-positive cells were observed. Treatment with fusion inhibitory peptides showed that MeV production after apical infection was not dependent on infection of the basolateral surface. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that MeV infection is initiated by apical infection of respiratory epithelial cells with subsequent infection of lymphoid tissue and systemic spread.},

  abstract = {Measles virus (MV), one of the most contagious viruses infecting humans, causes a systemic infection leading to fever, immune suppression, and a characteristic maculopapular rash. However, the specific mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the spread of MV into the respiratory epithelium in the late stages of the disease are unknown. Here we show the crucial role of PVRL4 in mediating the spread of MV from immune to epithelial cells by generating a PVRL4 "blind" recombinant wild-type MV and developing a novel in vitro coculture model of B cells with primary differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells. We utilized the macaque model of measles to analyze virus distribution in the respiratory tract prior to and at the peak of MV replication. Expression of PVRL4 was widespread in both the lower and upper respiratory tract (URT) of macaques, indicating MV transmission can be facilitated by more than only epithelial cells of the trachea. Analysis of tissues collected at early time points after experimental MV infection demonstrated the presence of MV-infected lymphoid and myeloid cells contacting respiratory tract epithelium in the absence of infected epithelial cells, suggesting that these immune cells seed the infection in vivo. Thereafter, lateral cell-to-cell spread of MV led to the formation of large foci of infected cells in the trachea and high levels of MV infection in the URT, particularly in the nasal cavity. These novel findings have important implications for our understanding of the high transmissibility of measles.},

  abstract = {Extensive global sampling and sequencing of the pandemic virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have enabled researchers to monitor its spread and to identify concerning new variants. Two important determinants of variant spread are how frequently they arise within individuals and how likely they are to be transmitted. To characterize within-host diversity and transmission, we deep-sequenced 1313 clinical samples from the United Kingdom. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by low levels of within-host diversity when viral loads are high and by a narrow bottleneck at transmission. Most variants are either lost or occasionally fixed at the point of transmission, with minimal persistence of shared diversity, patterns that are readily observable on the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that transmission-enhancing and/or immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to arise infrequently but could spread rapidly if successfully transmitted.},

  abstract = {Amplification of signals by the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a powerful approach for increasing signal strength in single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, but probes tagged with an HCR initiator sequence are prone to producing false signals. Here we describe a system of interacting hairpin binary probes in which the HCR initiator sequence is conditionally sequestered. The binding of these probes to a perfectly complementary target unmasks the initiator, enabling the generation of an amplified signal. This probe system can distinguish single-nucleotide variations within single mRNA molecules and produces amplified signals in situ for both mutant and wild-type variants, each in a distinguishable color. This technology will augment studies of imbalanced allelic expression and will be useful for the detection of somatic mutations in cancer biopsies. By tiling these probes along the length of an mRNA target, enhanced signals can be obtained, thereby enabling the scanning of tissue sections for gene expression utilizing lower magnification microscopy, overcoming tissue autofluorescence, and allowing the detection of low-abundance biomarkers in flow cytometry.},

The transmission bottleneck determines how much of the viral diversity generated in one host passes to another during transmission. It therefore plays a vital role in linking within-host processes to larger evolutionary trends. Although many studies suggest that transmission severely restricts the amount of genetic diversity that passes between individuals, there are important exceptions to this rule. In many cases, the factors that determine the size of the transmission bottleneck are only beginning to be understood. Here, we review how transmission bottlenecks are measured, how they arise, and their consequences for viral evolution.},

  abstract = {With next-generation sequencing technologies, it is now feasible to efficiently sequence patient-derived virus populations at a depth of coverage sufficient to detect rare variants. However, each sequencing platform has characteristic error profiles, and sample collection, target amplification, and library preparation are additional processes whereby errors are introduced and propagated. Many studies account for these errors by using ad hoc quality thresholds and/or previously published statistical algorithms. Despite common usage, the majority of these approaches have not been validated under conditions that characterize many studies of intrahost diversity. Here, we use defined populations of influenza virus to mimic the diversity and titer typically found in patient-derived samples. We identified single-nucleotide variants using two commonly employed variant callers, Deep-SNV and LoFreq. We found that the accuracy of these variant callers was lower than expected and exquisitely sensitive to the input titer. Small reductions in specificity had a significant impact on the number of minority variants identified and subsequent measures of diversity. We were able to increase the specificity of DeepSNV to \textquestiondown 99.95\% by applying an empirically validated set of quality thresholds. When applied to a set of influenza virus samples from a household-based cohort study, these changes resulted in a 10-fold reduction in measurements of viral diversity. We have made our sequence data and analysis code available so that others may improve on our work and use our data set to benchmark their own bioinformatics pipelines. Our work demonstrates that inadequate quality control and validation can lead to significant overestimation of intrahost diversity. IMPORTANCE Advances in sequencing technology have made it feasible to sequence patient-derived viral samples at a level sufficient for detection of rare mutations. These high-throughput, cost-effective methods are revolutionizing the study of within-host viral diversity. However, the techniques are error prone, and the methods commonly used to control for these errors have not been validated under the conditions that characterize patient-derived samples. Here, we show that these conditions affect measurements of viral diversity. We found that the accuracy of previously benchmarked analysis pipelines was greatly reduced under patient-derived conditions. By carefully validating our sequencing analysis using known control samples, we were able to identify biases in our method and to improve our accuracy to acceptable levels. Application of our modified pipeline to a set of influenza virus samples from a cohort study provided a realistic picture of intrahost diversity and suggested the need for rigorous quality control in such studies.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary dynamics of influenza virus ultimately derive from processes that take place within and between infected individuals. Here we define influenza virus dynamics in human hosts through sequencing of 249 specimens from 200 individuals collected over 6290 person seasons of observation. Because these viruses were collected from individuals in a prospective community-based cohort, they are broadly representative of natural infections with seasonal viruses. Consistent with a neutral model of evolution, sequence data from 49 serially sampled individuals illustrated the dynamic turnover of synonymous and nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants and provided little evidence for positive selection of antigenic variants. We also identified 43 genetically-validated transmission pairs in this cohort. Maximum likelihood optimization of multiple transmission models estimated an effective transmission bottleneck of 1-2 genomes. Our data suggest that positive selection is inefficient at the level of the individual host and that stochastic processes dominate the host-level evolution of influenza viruses.},

  abstract = {It is becoming clear that the manner by which the immune response resolves or contains infection by a pathogen varies according to the tissue that is affected. Unlike many peripheral cell types, CNS neurons are generally non-renewable. Thus, the cytolytic and inflammatory strategies that are effective in controlling infections in the periphery could be damaging if deployed in the CNS. Perhaps for this reason, the immune response to some CNS viral infections favours maintenance of neuronal integrity and non-neurolytic viral control. This modified immune response \textemdash{} when combined with the unique anatomy and physiology of the CNS \textemdash{} provides an ideal environment for the maintenance of viral genomes, including those of RNA viruses. Therefore, it is possible that such viruses can reactivate long after initial viral exposure, contributing to CNS disease.},

It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.~Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

  abstract = {The generation of replication-competent measles virus (MV) depends on the incorporation of biologically active, fusogenic glycoprotein complexes, which are required for attachment and penetration into susceptible host cells and for direct virus spread by cell-to-cell fusion. Whereas multiple studies have analyzed the importance of the ectodomains of the MV glycoproteins hemagglutinin (H) and fusion protein (F), we have investigated the role of the cytoplasmic tails of the F and H proteins for the formation of fusogenic complexes. Deletions in the cytoplasmic tails of transiently expressed MV glycoproteins were found to have varying effects on receptor binding, fusion, or fusion promotion activity. F tail truncation to only three amino acids did not affect fusion capacity. In contrast, truncation of the H cytoplasmic tail was limited. H protein mutants with cytoplasmic tails of {$<$}14 residues no longer supported F-mediated cell fusion, predominantly due to a decrease in surface expression and receptor binding. This indicates that a minimal length of the H protein tail of 14 amino acids is required to ensure a threshold local density to have sufficient accumulation of fusogenic H-F complexes. By using reverse genetics, a recombinant MV with an F tail of three amino acids (rMV-Fc{$\Delta$}30), as well as an MV with an H tail of 14 residues (rMV-Hc{$\Delta$}20), could be rescued, whereas generation of viruses with shorter H tails failed. Thus, glycoprotein truncation does not interfere with the successful generation of recombinant MV if fusion competence is maintained.},

However, in most cases infection is asymptomatic and limited to the gastrointestinal tract, where virus is amplified for transmission. Picornaviruses have previously been shown to exit infected cells via either cell lysis or secretion of vesicles. Here we report that entire Enterovirus A71-infected cells are specifically extruded from the apical surface of differentiated human colon organoids, as observed by confocal microscopy. Differential sensitivity to chemical and peptide inhibitors demonstrated that extrusion of virus-infected cells is dependent on force sensing via mechanosensitive ion channels rather than apoptotic cell death. When isolated and used as inoculum, intact virus-containing extruded cells can initiate new infections. In contrast, when mechanical force sensing is inhibited, large amounts of free virus are released. Thus, extrusion of live, virus-infected cells from intact epithelial tissue is likely to benefit both the integrity of host tissues and the protected spread of this faecal-oral pathogen within and between hosts.},

  abstract = {Measles virus is an aerosol-transmitted virus that affects more than 10 million children each year and accounts for approximately 120,000 deaths. Although it was long believed to replicate in the respiratory epithelium before disseminating, it was recently shown to infect initially macrophages and dendritic cells of the airways using signalling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1; also called CD150) as a receptor. These cells then cross the respiratory epithelium and transport the infection to lymphatic organs where measles virus replicates vigorously. How and where the virus crosses back into the airways has remained unknown. On the basis of functional analyses of surface proteins preferentially expressed on virus-permissive human epithelial cell lines, here we identify nectin-4 (ref. 8; also called poliovirus-receptor-like-4 (PVRL4)) as a candidate host exit receptor. This adherens junction protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily interacts with the viral attachment protein with high affinity through its membrane-distal domain. Nectin-4 sustains measles virus entry and non-cytopathic lateral spread in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial sheets infected basolaterally. It is downregulated in infected epithelial cells, including those of macaque tracheae. Although other viruses use receptors to enter hosts or transit through their epithelial barriers, we suggest that measles virus targets nectin-4 to emerge in the airways. Nectin-4 is a cellular marker of several types of cancer, which has implications for ongoing measles-virus-based clinical trials of oncolysis.},

Given the rapid increase in the number of cases in many localities, the availability of accurate, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing is vital to efforts to manage the current public health crisis. In the course of optimizing SARS-CoV-2 testing performed by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Lab (UW Virology Lab), we evaluated assays using seven different primer-probe sets and one assay kit. We found that the most sensitive assays were those that used the E-gene primerprobe set described by Corman et al. (V. M. Corman, O. Landt, M. Kaiser, R.

All assays tested were found to be highly specific for SARS-CoV-2, with no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses observed in our analyses regardless of the primer-probe set or kit used. These results will provide valuable information to other clinical laboratories who are actively developing SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols at a time when increased testing capacity is urgently needed worldwide.},

  abstract = {Research in the last decade has uncovered many new paramyxoviruses, airborne agents that cause epidemic diseases in animals including humans. Most paramyxoviruses enter epithelial cells of the airway using sialic acid as a receptor and cause only mild disease. However, others cross the epithelial barrier and cause more severe disease. For some of these viruses, the host receptors have been identified, and the mechanisms of cell entry have been elucidated. The tetrameric attachment proteins of paramyxoviruses have vastly different binding affinities for their cognate receptors, which they contact through different binding surfaces. Nevertheless, all input signals are converted to the same output: conformational changes that trigger refolding of trimeric fusion proteins and membrane fusion. Experiments with selectively receptor-blinded viruses inoculated into their natural hosts have provided insights into tropism, identifying the cells and tissues that support growth and revealing the mechanisms of pathogenesis. These analyses also shed light on diabolically elegant mechanisms used by morbilliviruses, including the measles virus, to promote massive amplification within the host, followed by efficient aerosolization and rapid spread through host populations. In another paradigm of receptor-facilitated severe disease, henipaviruses, including Nipah and Hendra viruses, use different members of one protein family to cause zoonoses. Specific properties of different paramyxoviruses, like neurotoxicity and immunosuppression, are now understood in the light of receptor specificity. We propose that research on the specific receptors for several newly identified members of the Paramyxoviridae family that may not bind sialic acid is needed to anticipate their zoonotic potential and to generate effective vaccines and antiviral compounds.},

Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship among the three strains of SSPE virus. The cytoplasmic tail of the F protein, predicted from sequence analysis of the gene, is altered in all three SSPE strains when compared to the MV field strains. However, the extent and mode of alteration are different in each strain. The F protein of the Osaka-1 strain has six nonconservative amino acid substitutions and a 29-residue elongation of its cytoplasmic tail. The F protein of the Osaka-3 strain has two nonconservative substitutions and a 5-residue truncation of its C-terminus. Although the termination codon is not altered in the F protein of the Osaka-2 strain, five or six amino acids are changed in the cytoplasmic tail of the F protein of the two sibling viruses of this strain. The significance of the altered cytoplasmic domain of the SSPE viruses in the SSPE pathogenesis is discussed.},

In CV-1 cells infected with SSPE viruses, smooth filaments formed large intranuclear inclusions and granular filaments occupied a large area of the cytoplasm, but always spared the area under the cell membrane. Particles budding from the surface of these cells contained no nucleocapsids. In CV-1 cells infected with measles virus, only small aggregates of smooth filaments were seen in the nuclei. Granular filaments in the cytoplasm predominantly occupied the area under the cell membrane, and were aligned beneath the cell membrane in a parallel fashion and assembled into budding particles. These differences between SSPE and measles virus may be regarded as quantitative, but they do distinguish SSPE viruses from measles virus. Moreover, the formation of large nuclear inclusions filled with smooth filaments appears to be a characteristic process of SSPE, but not of measles, since this type of inclusion is invariably seen in SSPE brain tissues, brain cultures derived from them, and CV-1 cells infected with SSPE viruses.},

  abstract = {Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain uniformly leading to death. Although caused by measles virus (MV), the virus recovered from patients with SSPE differs from wild-type MV; biologically SSPE virus is defective and its genome displays a variety of mutations among which biased replacements of many uridine by cytidine resides primarily in the matrix (M) gene. To address the question of whether the SSPE MVs with M mutations are passive in that they are not infectious, cannot spread within the CNS, and basically represent an end-stage result of a progressive infection or alternatively SSPE viruses are infectious, and their mutations enable them to persist and thereby cause a prolonged neurodegenerative disease, we utilized reverse genetics to generate an infectious virus in which the M gene of MV was replaced with the M gene of Biken strain SSPE MV and inoculated the recombinant virus into transgenic mice bearing the MV receptor. Our results indicate that despite biased hypermutations in the M gene, the virus is infectious in vivo and produces a protracted progressive infection with death occurring as long as 30 to 50 days after that caused by MV. In primary neuron cultures, the mutated M protein is not essential for MV replication, prevents colocalization of the viral N with membrane glycoproteins, and is associated with accumulation of nucleocapsids in cells' cytoplasm and nucleus.},

Alternative promoters and splicing produce two ADAR1 proteins, an interferon-inducible cytoplasmic p150 and a constitutively expressed p110 that like ADAR2 is a nuclear enzyme. ADAR3 lacks deaminase activity. A-to-I editing occurs with both viral and cellular RNAs. Deamination activity is dependent on dsRNA substrate structure and regulatory RNA-binding proteins and ranges from highly site selective with hepatitis D RNA and glutamate receptor precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) to hyperediting of measles virus and polyomavirus transcripts and cellular inverted Alu elements. Because I base-pairs as guanosine instead of A, editing can alter mRNA decoding, pre-mRNA splicing, and microRNA silencing. Editing also alters dsRNA structure, thereby suppressing innate immune responses including interferon production and action.},

  abstract = {The interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune response is the first line of defense against viruses. However, an IFN-stimulated gene, the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), favors the replication of several viruses. ADAR1 binds double-stranded RNA and converts adenosine to inosine by deamination. This form of editing makes duplex RNA unstable, thereby preventing IFN induction. To better understand how ADAR1 works at the cellular level, we generated cell lines that express exclusively either the IFN-inducible, cytoplasmic isoform ADAR1p150, the constitutively expressed nuclear isoform ADAR1p110, or no isoform. By comparing the transcriptome of these cell lines, we identified more than 150 polymerase II transcripts that are extensively edited, and we attributed most editing events to ADAR1p150. Editing is focused on inverted transposable elements, located mainly within introns and untranslated regions, and predicted to form duplex RNA structures. Editing of these elements occurs also in primary human samples, and there is evidence for cross-species evolutionary conservation of editing patterns in primates and, to a lesser extent, in rodents. Whereas ADAR1p150 rarely edits tightly encapsidated standard measles virus (MeV) genomes, it efficiently edits genomes with inverted repeats accidentally generated by a mutant MeV. We also show that immune activation occurs in fully ADAR1-deficient (ADAR1KO) cells, restricting virus growth, and that complementation of these cells with ADAR1p150 rescues virus growth and suppresses innate immunity activation. Finally, by knocking out either protein kinase R (PKR) or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-another protein controlling the response to duplex RNA-in ADAR1KO cells, we show that PKR activation elicits a stronger antiviral response. Thus, ADAR1 prevents innate immunity activation by cellular transcripts that include extensive duplex RNA structures. The trade-off is that viruses take advantage of ADAR1 to elude innate immunity control.},

  abstract = {Defective interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs) of the viral genome can form during infections of negative-strand RNA viruses and outgrow full-length viral genomes, thereby modulating the severity and duration of infection. Here we document the frequent de novo generation of copy-back DI-RNAs from independent rescue events both for a vaccine measles virus (vac2) and for a wild-type measles virus (IC323) as early as passage 1 after virus rescue. Moreover, vaccine and wild-type C-protein-deficient (C-protein-knockout [CKO]) measles viruses generated about 10 times more DI-RNAs than parental virus, suggesting that C enhances the processivity of the viral polymerase. We obtained the nucleotide sequences of 65 individual DI-RNAs, identified breakpoints and reinitiation sites, and predicted their structural features. Several DI-RNAs possessed clusters of A-to-G or U-to-C transitions. Sequences flanking these mutation sites were characteristic of those favored by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1), which catalyzes in double-stranded RNA the C-6 deamination of adenosine to produce inosine, which is recognized as guanosine, a process known as A-to-I RNA editing. In individual DI-RNAs the transitions were of the same type and occurred on both sides of the breakpoint. These patterns of mutations suggest that ADAR1 edits unencapsidated DI-RNAs that form double-strand RNA structures. Encapsidated DI-RNAs were incorporated into virus particles, which reduced the infectivity of virus stocks. The CKO phenotype was dominant: DI-RNAs derived from vac2 with a CKO suppressed the replication of vac2, as shown by coinfections of interferon-incompetent lymphatic cells with viruses expressing different fluorescent reporter proteins. In contrast, coinfection with a C-protein-expressing virus did not counteract the suppressive phenotype of DI-RNAs., IMPORTANCE Recombinant measles viruses (MVs) are in clinical trials as cancer therapeutics and as vectored vaccines for HIV-AIDS and other infectious diseases. The efficacy of MV-based vectors depends on their replication proficiency and immune activation capacity. Here we document that copy-back defective interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs) are generated by recombinant vaccine and wild-type MVs immediately after rescue. The MV C protein interferes with DI-RNA generation and may enhance the processivity of the viral polymerase. We frequently detected clusters of A-to-G or U-to-C transitions and noted that sequences flanking individual mutations contain motifs favoring recognition by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1). The consistent type of transitions on the DI-RNAs indicates that these are direct substrates for editing by ADAR1. The ADAR1-mediated biased hypermutation events are consistent with the protein kinase R (PKR)-ADAR1 balancing model of innate immunity activation. We show by coinfection that the C-defective phenotype is dominant.},

While the technique is widely applied, varying error rates have been observed. We analysed millions of reads obtained after sequencing of one single sequence on an Illumina sequencer. According to our analysis, the index-PCR for sample preparation has no effect on the observed error rate, even though PCR is traditionally seen as one of the major contributors to enhanced error rates in NGS. In addition, we observed very persistent pre-phasing effects although the base calling software corrects for these. Removal of shortened sequences abolished these effects and allowed analysis of the actual mutations. The average error rate determined was 0.24 +/- 0.06\% per base and the percentage of mutated sequences was found to be 6.4 +/- 1.24\%. Constant regions at the 5'-and 3'-end, e.g., primer binding sites used in in vitro selection procedures seem to have no effect on mutation rates and re-sequencing of samples obtains very reproducible results. As phasing effects and other sequencing problems vary between equipment and individual setups, we recommend evaluation of error rates and types to all NGS-users to improve the quality and analysis of NGS data.},

Here, we provide a national-scale analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) superspreading during the first wave of infections in Austria, a country that played a major role in initial virus transmissions in Europe. Capitalizing on Austria's well-developed epidemiological surveillance system, we identified major SARS-CoV-2 clusters during the first wave of infections and performed deep whole-genome sequencing of more than 500 virus samples. Phylogenetic-epidemiological analysis enabled the reconstruction of superspreading events and charts a map of tourism-related viral spread originating from Austria in spring 2020. Moreover, we exploited epidemiologically well-defined clusters to quantify SARS-CoV-2 mutational dynamics, including the observation of low-frequency mutations that progressed to fixation within the infection chain. Time-resolved virus sequencing unveiled viral mutation dynamics within individuals with COVID-19, and epidemiologically validated infector-infectee pairs enabled us to determine an average transmission bottleneck size of 10(3) SARS-CoV-2 particles. In conclusion, this study illustrates the power of combining epidemiological analysis with deep viral genome sequencing to unravel the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to gain fundamental insights into mutational dynamics and transmission properties.},

We first show that this system can accurately map how all functionally tolerated mutations to Env affect neutralization by monoclonal antibodies. We then comprehensively map Env mutations that affect neutralization by a set of human polyclonal sera that neutralize diverse strains of HIV and target the site engaging the host receptor CD4. The neutralizing activities of these sera target different epitopes, with most sera having specificities reminiscent of individual characterized monoclonal antibodies, but one serum targeting two epitopes within the CD4-binding site. Mapping the specificity of the neutralizing activity in polyclonal human serum will aid in assessing anti-HIV immune responses to inform prevention strategies.},

After acute measles, CNS complications may occur early (acute postinfectious measles encephalitis, APME) or after years of viral persistence (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, SSPE). In spite of a presumably functional cell-mediated immunity and high antiviral antibody titers, an immunological control of the CNS infection is not achieved in patients suffering from SSPE. There is still no specific therapy for acute complications and persistent MV infections of the CNS. Hamsters, rats, and (genetically unmodified and modified) mice have been used as model systems to study mechanisms of MV-induced CNS infections. Functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells together with IFN-gamma are required to overcome the infection. With the help of recombinant measles viruses and mice expressing endogenous or transgenic receptors, interesting aspects such as receptor-dependent viral spread and viral determinants of virulence have been investigated. However, many questions concerning the lack of efficient immune control in the CNS are still open. Recent research opened new perspectives using specific antivirals such as short interfering RNA (siRNA) or small molecule inhibitors. Inspite of obvious hurdles, these treatments are the most promising approaches to future therapies.},

This has greatly increased our ability to study the diversity of transcription mechanisms such as transcription initiation, termination, and alternative splicing. However, ONT still suffers from high error rates which have thus far limited its scope to reference-based analyses. When a reference is not available or is not a viable option due to reference-bias, error correction is a crucial step towards the reconstruction of the sequenced transcripts and downstream sequence analysis of transcripts. In this paper, we present a novel computational method to error correct ONT cDNA sequencing data, called isONcorrect. IsONcorrect is able to jointly use all isoforms from a gene during error correction, thereby allowing it to correct reads at low sequencing depths. We are able to obtain a median accuracy of 98.9-99.6\%, demonstrating the feasibility of applying cost-effective cDNA full transcript length sequencing for reference-free transcriptome analysis.},

Instead, viral spread is often mediated by structures that simultaneously transport groups of viral genomes, such as polyploid virions, aggregates of virions, virion-containing proteinaceous structures, secreted lipid vesicles, and virus-induced cell-cell contacts. These structures increase the multiplicity of infection, independently of viral population density and transmission bottlenecks. Collective infectious units may contribute to the maintenance of viral genetic diversity, and could have implications for the evolution of social-like virus-virus interactions. These may include various forms of cooperation such as immunity evasion, genetic complementation, division of labor, and relaxation of fitness trade-offs, but also noncooperative interactions such as negative dominance and interference, potentially leading to conflict.},

Its rapid global spread has resulted in a major public health emergency, necessitating commensurately rapid research to improve control strategies. In particular, the ability to effectively retrace transmission chains in outbreaks remains a major challenge, partly due to our limited understanding of the virus' underlying evolutionary dynamics within and between hosts. We used high-throughput sequencing whole-genome data coupled with bottleneck analysis to retrace the pathways of viral transmission in two nosocomial outbreaks that were previously characterised by epidemiological and phylogenetic methods. Additionally, we assessed the mutational landscape, selection pressures, and diversity at the within-host level for both outbreaks. Our findings show evidence of within-host selection and transmission of variants between samples. Both bottleneck and diversity analyses highlight within-host and consensus-level variants shared by putative source-recipient pairs in both outbreaks, suggesting that certain within-host variants in these outbreaks may have been transmitted upon infection rather than arising de novo independently within multiple hosts. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of combining within-host diversity and bottleneck estimations for elucidating transmission events in SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, provide insight into the maintenance of viral genetic diversity, provide a list of candidate targets of positive selection for further investigation, and demonstrate that within-host variants can be transferred between patients. Together these results will help in developing strategies to understand the nature of transmission events and curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract = {Measles virus (MV) usually causes acute infection but in rare cases persists in the brain, resulting in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Since human neurons, an important target affected in the disease, do not express the known MV receptors (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule [SLAM] and nectin 4), how MV infects neurons and spreads between them is unknown. Recent studies have shown that many virus strains isolated from SSPE patients possess substitutions in the extracellular domain of the fusion (F) protein which confer enhanced fusion activity. Hyperfusogenic viruses with such mutations, unlike the wild-type MV, can induce cell-cell fusion even in SLAM- and nectin 4-negative cells and spread efficiently in human primary neurons and the brains of animal models. We show here that a hyperfusogenic mutant MV, IC323-F(T461I)-EGFP (IC323 with a fusion-enhancing T461I substitution in the F protein and expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein), but not the wild-type MV, spreads in differentiated NT2 cells, a widely used human neuron model. Confocal time-lapse imaging revealed the cell-to-cell spread of IC323-F(T461I)-EGFP between NT2 neurons without syncytium formation. The production of virus particles was strongly suppressed in NT2 neurons, also supporting cell-to-cell viral transmission. The spread of IC323-F(T461I)-EGFP was inhibited by a fusion inhibitor peptide as well as by some but not all of the anti-hemagglutinin antibodies which neutralize SLAM- or nectin-4-dependent MV infection, suggesting the presence of a distinct neuronal receptor. Our results indicate that MV spreads in a cell-to-cell manner between human neurons without causing syncytium formation and that the spread is dependent on the hyperfusogenic F protein, the hemagglutinin, and the putative neuronal receptor for MV.IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MV), in rare cases, persists in the human central nervous system (CNS) and causes subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) several years after acute infection. This neurological complication is almost always fatal, and there is currently no effective treatment for it. Mechanisms by which MV invades the CNS and causes the disease remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that fusion-enhancing substitutions in the fusion protein of MVs isolated from SSPE patients contribute to MV spread in neurons. In this study, we demonstrate that MV bearing the hyperfusogenic mutant fusion protein spreads between human neurons in a cell-to-cell manner. Spread of the virus was inhibited by a fusion inhibitor peptide and antibodies against the MV hemagglutinin, indicating that both the hemagglutinin and hyperfusogenic fusion protein play important roles in MV spread between human neurons. The findings help us better understand the disease process of SSPE.},

Now this MV genomic region has been investigated in eight additional SSPE cases by PCR amplification, replacement cloning into a vector containing the F gene of a lytic MV, in vitro expression, and sequencing. In all cases at least part of the clones showed mutations leading to F protein truncations, elongation, or nonconservative amino acid replacements.

  abstract = {Two sibling viruses of the subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) virus Osaka-2 strain were isolated from a small biopsy specimen of the brain of an SSPE patient just before intraventricular interferon treatment by cocultivation with two different cell lines, Vero cells or B95a cells (Ogura et al, 1997). Both the virus-infected cells were found to be indistinguishable from each other in defective production of cell-free virus and in defective expression of the matrix (M) protein. The sequence analysis of the M genes predicted that they were translatable due to a lack of alteration of the translational start and stop codons for the proteins. A different pattern of the M monocistronic transcripts, however, was observed in a Northern blot analysis of the infected cells. This different pattern was confirmed further by a primer extension analysis. The undetectable expressions of the M proteins in the sibling virus-infected cells are most probably different in their molecular mechanisms. All these results indicate the possibility that the two different, replicable variants existed at Jabbour stage III of the disease's progression in a very small portion of the brain, where no lesion had yet been recognized by a magnetic resonance imaging.},

  abstract = {Measles virus (MeV), an enveloped RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae, is still an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. MeV usually causes acute febrile illness with skin rash, but in rare cases persists in the brain, causing a progressive neurological disorder, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The disease is fatal, and no effective therapy is currently available. Although transsynaptic cell-to-cell transmission is thought to account for MeV propagation in the brain, neurons do not express the known receptors for MeV. Recent studies have shown that hyperfusogenic changes in the MeV fusion (F) protein play a key role in MeV propagation in the brain. However, how such mutant viruses spread in neurons remains unexplained. Here, we show that cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1; also known as IGSF4A, Necl-2, and SynCAM1) and CADM2 (also known as IGSF4D, Necl-3, SynCAM2) are host factors that enable MeV to cause membrane fusion in cells lacking the known receptors and to spread between neurons. During enveloped virus entry, a cellular receptor generally interacts in trans with the attachment protein on the envelope. However, CADM1 and CADM2 interact in cis with the MeV attachment protein on the same cell membrane, causing the fusion protein triggering and membrane fusion. Knockdown of CADM1 and CADM2 inhibits syncytium formation and virus transmission between neurons that are both mediated by hyperfusogenic F proteins. Thus, our results unravel the molecular mechanism (receptor-mimicking cis-acting fusion triggering) by which MeV spreads transsynaptically between neurons, thereby causing SSPE. IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV), an enveloped RNA virus, is the causative agent of measles, which is still an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. Persistent MeV infection in the brain causes a fatal progressive neurological disorder, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), several years after acute infection. However, how MeV spreads in neurons, which are mainly affected in SSPE, remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) and CADM2 are host factors enabling MeV spread between neurons. During enveloped virus entry, a cellular receptor generally interacts in trans with the attachment protein on the viral membrane (envelope). Remarkably, CADM1 and CADM2 interact in cis with the MeV attachment protein on the same membrane, triggering the fusion protein and causing membrane fusion, as viral receptors usually do in trans. Careful screening may lead to more examples of such "receptor-mimicking cis-acting fusion triggering" in other viruses.},

The persisting MeVs have hyperfusogenic mutant fusion (F) proteins that likely enable cell-cell fusion at synapses and "en bloc transmission" between neurons. We here show that during persistence, F protein fusogenicity is generally enhanced by cumulative mutations, yet mutations paradoxically reducing the fusogenicity may be selected alongside the wild-type (non-neurotropic) MeV genome. A mutant F protein having SSPE-derived substitutions exhibits lower fusogenicity than the hyperfusogenic F protein containing some of those substitutions, but by the wild-type F protein coexpression, the fusogenicity of the former F protein is enhanced, while that of the latter is nearly abolished. These findings advance the understanding of the long-term process of MeV neuropathogenicity and provide critical insight into the genotype-phenotype relationships of en bloc transmitted viruses.},

Measles virus, an enveloped RNA virus, has a fusion protein mediating fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. Here we observe that a non-fusogenic recombinant measles virus evolves, after passages, into mutant viruses which regain the ability to induce membrane fusion.

Neither the wild-type nor mutant protein by itself is able to mediate membrane fusion, but both together exhibit enhanced fusion activity through hetero-oligomer formation.

  abstract = {Measles virus (MeV) is a highly contagious human pathogen that continues to be a worldwide health burden. One of the challenges for the study of MeV spread is the identification of model systems that accurately reflect how MeV behaves in humans. For our studies, we use unpassaged, well-differentiated primary cultures of airway epithelial cells from human donor lungs to examine MeV infection and spread. Here, we show that the main components of the MeV ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), the nucleocapsid and phosphoprotein, colocalize with the apical and circumapical F-actin networks. To better understand how MeV infections spread across the airway epithelium, we generated a recombinant virus incorporating chimeric fluorescent proteins in its RNP complex. By live cell imaging, we observed rapid movement of RNPs along the circumapical F-actin rings of newly infected cells. This strikingly rapid mechanism of horizontal trafficking across epithelia is consistent with the opening of pores between columnar cells by the viral membrane fusion apparatus. Our work provides mechanistic insights into how MeV rapidly spreads through airway epithelial cells, contributing to its extremely contagious nature.IMPORTANCE The ability of viral particles to directly spread cell to cell within the airways without particle release is considered to be highly advantageous to many respiratory viruses. Our previous studies in well-differentiated, primary human airway epithelial cells suggest that measles virus (MeV) spreads cell to cell by eliciting the formation of intercellular membrane pores. Based on a newly generated ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) "tracker" virus, we document by live-cell microscopy that MeV RNPs move along F-actin rings before entering a new cell. Thus, rather than diffusing through the cytoplasm of a newly infected columnar cell, RNPs take advantage of the cytoskeletal infrastructure to rapidly spread laterally across the human airway epithelium. This results in rapid horizontal spread through the epithelium that does not require particle release.},

  abstract = {Measles virus (MeV), an enveloped RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae, usually causes acute febrile illness with skin rash but in rare cases persists in the brain, causing a progressive neurological disorder, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). MeV bears two envelope glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins. The H protein possesses a head domain that initially mediates receptor binding and a stalk domain that subsequently transmits the fusion-triggering signal to the F protein. We recently showed that cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1; also known as IGSF4A, Necl-2, and SynCAM1) and CADM2 (also known as IGSF4D, Necl-3, and SynCAM2) are host factors enabling cell-cell membrane fusion mediated by hyperfusogenic F proteins of neuropathogenic MeVs as well as MeV spread between neurons lacking the known receptors. CADM1 and CADM2 interact in cis with the H protein on the same cell membrane, triggering hyperfusogenic F protein-mediated membrane fusion. Multiple isoforms of CADM1 and CADM2 containing various lengths of their stalk regions are generated by alternative splicing. Here, we show that only short-stalk isoforms of CADM1 and CADM2 predominantly expressed in the brain induce hyperfusogenic F protein-mediated membrane fusion. While the known receptors interact in trans with the H protein through its head domain, these isoforms can interact in cis even with the H protein lacking the head domain and trigger membrane fusion, presumably through its stalk domain. Thus, our results unveil a new mechanism of viral fusion triggering by host factors.

Transfection with a human SLAM complementary DNA enables non-susceptible cell lines to bind measles virus, support measles virus replication and develop cytopathic effects. The distribution of SLAM on various cell lines is consistent with their susceptibility to clinical isolates of measles virus.

  abstract = {Influenza B virus (IBV) undergoes seasonal antigenic drift more slowly than influenza A virus, but the reasons for this difference are unclear. While the evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses play out globally, they are fundamentally driven by mutation, reassortment, drift, and selection at the level of individual hosts. These processes have recently been described for influenza A virus, but little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of IBV during individual infections and transmission events. Here, we define the within-host evolutionary dynamics of IBV by sequencing virus populations from naturally infected individuals enrolled in a prospective, community-based cohort over 8,176 person-seasons of observation. Through analysis of high depth-of-coverage sequencing data from samples from 91 individuals with influenza B, we find that IBV accumulates lower genetic diversity than previously observed for influenza A virus during acute infections. Consistent with studies of influenza A viruses, the within-host evolution of IBVs is characterized by purifying selection and the general absence of widespread positive selection of within-host variants. Analysis of shared genetic diversity across 15 sequence-validated transmission pairs suggests that IBV experiences a tight transmission bottleneck similar to that of influenza A virus. These patterns of local-scale evolution are consistent with the lower global evolutionary rate of IBV. IMPORTANCE The evolution of influenza virus is a significant public health problem and necessitates the annual evaluation of influenza vaccine formulation to keep pace with viral escape from herd immunity. Influenza B virus is a serious health concern for children, in particular, yet remains understudied compared to influenza A virus. Influenza B virus evolves more slowly than influenza A virus, but the factors underlying this are not completely understood. We studied how the within-host diversity of influenza B virus relates to its global evolution by sequencing viruses from a community-based cohort. We found that influenza B virus populations have lower within-host genetic diversity than influenza A virus and experience a tight genetic bottleneck during transmission. Our work provides insights into the varying dynamics of influenza viruses in human infection.},

  abstract = {Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity within infected hosts can provide insight into the generation and spread of new viral variants and may enable high resolution inference of transmission chains. However, little is known about temporal aspects of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost diversity and the extent to which shared diversity reflects convergent evolution as opposed to transmission linkage. Here we use high depth of coverage sequencing to identify within-host genetic variants in 325 specimens from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and infected employees at a single medical center. We validated our variant calling by sequencing defined RNA mixtures and identified viral load as a critical factor in variant identification. By leveraging clinical metadata, we found that intrahost diversity is low and does not vary by time from symptom onset. This suggests that variants will only rarely rise to appreciable frequency prior to transmission. Although there was generally little shared variation across the sequenced cohort, we identified intrahost variants shared across individuals who were unlikely to be related by transmission. These variants did not precede a rise in frequency in global consensus genomes, suggesting that intrahost variants may have limited utility for predicting future lineages. These results provide important context for sequence-based inference in SARS-CoV-2 evolution and epidemiology. Author summary Understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is important for designing public health interventions to prevent outbreaks. Viral genome sequencing has been widely used to reconstruct patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through communities and to monitor the spread of new strains. However, because SARS-CoV-2 can transmit multiple times before a new mutation fixes, consensus sequences often cannot determine ``who infected whom.'' Identifying individuals who share the same viral genetic variants at low frequencies within each infection may help resolve this problem, but to do this we need to accurately identify within-host genetic variants and understand how they evolve and spread. We investigated within-host diversity of SARS-CoV-2 with samples collected in southeastern Michigan in March-May 2020. We show that there are relatively few genetic variants present in any given infection, and variants do not tend to accumulate in people over time. We also found that people who are not part of the same epidemic cluster can share the same within-host variants, due to chance or various evolutionary forces.},

  abstract = {Key questions in COVID-19 are the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding. Here, we report that infectious virus shedding is detected by virus cultures in 23 of the 129 patients (17.8\%) hospitalized with COVID-19. The median duration of shedding infectious virus is 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5-11) and drops below 5\% after 15.2 days post onset of symptoms (95\% confidence interval (CI) 13.4-17.2). Multivariate analyses identify viral loads above 7 log(10) RNA copies/mL (odds ratio [OR] of 14.7 (CI 3.57-58.1; p\textexclamdown 0.001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract. A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0.01 (CI 0.003-0.08; p\textexclamdown 0.001) is independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2. We conclude that quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays could be used in test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions. Duration of infectious SARS-CoV-2 shedding is an important measure for improved disease control. Here, the authors use virus cultures of respiratory tract samples from COVID-19 patients and observe a median shedding duration of 8 days and a drop below 5\% after 15,2 days post onset of symptoms.},

  abstract = {Actin filament (F-actin) is believed to be involved in measles virus (MV) assembly as a cellular factor, but the precise roles remain unknown. Here we show that Phe at position 50 of the MV matrix (M) protein is important for its association with F-actin, through which the function of the M protein is regulated. In plasmid-expressed or MV-infected cells, a coimmunoprecipitation study revealed that the wild-type M (M-WT) protein associated strongly with F-actin but only weakly with the cytoplasmic tail of the hemagglutinin (H) protein. Since the F50P mutation allowed the M protein the enhanced interaction with the H protein in return for the sharply declined association with F-actin, the mutant M (M-F50P) protein strongly inhibited MV cell-cell fusion and promoted the uptake of the H protein into virus particles. The abundantly incorporated H protein resulted in the increase in infectivity of the F50P virus, although the virus contained a level of genome RNA equal to that of the WT virus. When the structure of F-actin was disrupted with cytochalasin D, the M-WT protein liberated from F-actin interacted with the H protein as tightly as the M-F50P protein, suppressing cell-cell fusion and promoting virus assembly comparably efficiently as the M-F50P protein. The cell-cell fusion activity of the WT virus appeared to be upheld by F-actin, which prevents the M protein interaction with the H protein. Our results indicate that F-actin in association with the M protein alters the interaction between the M and H proteins, thereby modulating MV cell-cell fusion and assembly.},

  abstract = {Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is caused by persistent measles virus (MV) infection in the central nervous system (CNS). Since human neurons, its main target cells, do not express known MV receptors (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule [SLAM] and nectin 4), it remains to be understood how MV infects and spreads in them. We have recently reported that fusion-enhancing substitutions in the extracellular domain of the MV fusion (F) protein (T461I and S103I/N462S/N465S), which are found in multiple SSPE virus isolates, promote MV spread in human neuroblastoma cell lines and brains of suckling hamsters. In this study, we show that hyperfusogenic viruses with these substitutions also spread efficiently in human primary neuron cultures without inducing syncytia. These substitutions were found to destabilize the prefusion conformation of the F protein trimer, thereby enhancing fusion activity. However, these hyperfusogenic viruses exhibited stronger cytopathology and produced lower titers at later time points in SLAM- or nectin 4-expressing cells compared to the wild-type MV. Although these viruses spread efficiently in the brains of SLAM knock-in mice, they did not in the spleens. Taken together, the results suggest that enhanced fusion activity is beneficial for MV to spread in neuronal cells where no cytopathology occurs, but detrimental to other types of cells due to strong cytopathology. Acquisition of enhanced fusion activity through substitutions in the extracellular domain of the F protein may be crucial for MV's extensive spread in the CNS and development of SSPE., IMPORTANCE Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a fatal disease caused by persistent measles virus (MV) infection in the central nervous system (CNS). Its cause is not well understood, and no effective therapy is currently available. Recently, we have reported that enhanced fusion activity of MV through the mutations in its fusion protein is a major determinant of efficient virus spread in human neuronal cells and brains of suckling hamsters. In this study, we show that those mutations render the conformation of the fusion protein less stable, thereby making it hyperfusogenic. Our results also show that enhanced fusion activity is beneficial for MV to spread in the CNS but detrimental to other types of cells in peripheral tissues, which are strongly damaged by the virus. Our findings provide important insight into the mechanism for the development of SSPE after MV infection.},

  abstract = {Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a fatal degenerative disease caused by persistent measles virus (MV) infection in the central nervous system (CNS). From the genetic study of MV isolates obtained from SSPE patients, it is thought that defects of the matrix (M) protein play a crucial role in MV pathogenicity in the CNS. In this study, we report several notable mutations in the extracellular domain of the MV fusion (F) protein, including those found in multiple SSPE strains. The F proteins with these mutations induced syncytium formation in cells lacking SLAM and nectin 4 (receptors used by wild-type MV), including human neuronal cell lines, when expressed together with the attachment protein hemagglutinin. Moreover, recombinant viruses with these mutations exhibited neurovirulence in suckling hamsters, unlike the parental wild-type MV, and the mortality correlated with their fusion activity. In contrast, the recombinant MV lacking the M protein did not induce syncytia in cells lacking SLAM and nectin 4, although it formed larger syncytia in cells with either of the receptors. Since human neuronal cells are mainly SLAM and nectin 4 negative, fusion-enhancing mutations in the extracellular domain of the F protein may greatly contribute to MV spread via cell-to-cell fusion in the CNS, regardless of defects of the M protein.},

  abstract = {MEASLES virus is thought to be responsible for the rare childhood disease subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)1\textendash 4, which is a slowly progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system occurring several years after an acute episode of measles. The physical and serological characteristics of SSPE virions isolated following cocultivation of infected brain cells bears a striking similarity to conventional measles virus1,2. Some SSPE strains, however, have been found to differ from measles virus in biological properties and RNA homologies5\textendash 10. There is also a report comparing the polypeptides of measles and SSPE virions in which an aberrant migration of the M polypeptide was noted11. Unfortunately, no polypeptide profiles were presented and better documentation of the finding has not been published. Several theories have been advanced to explain the mechanism by which measles virus can persist and produce SSPE. These include an abnormal host immune response to a measles virus infection, a second viral agent acting in coinfection with a measles-like virus, and a mutation of the parental measles virus12,13. In order to gain further insight into the nature of SSPE, we have compared the intracellular polypeptides of five SSPE isolates with those of measles virus.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a fatal complication of measles. We reviewed California cases from 1998-2015 to understand risk factors for SPPE and estimate incidence. METHODS: SSPE cases had clinically compatible symptoms and measles antibody detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or medical record documentation of SSPE. Cases were identified though a state death certificate search, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, or investigations for undiagnosed neurologic disease. Measles detection in CSF was performed by serology at the California Department of Public Health or at clinical laboratories. RESULTS: Seventeen SSPE cases were identified. Males outnumbered females 2.4:1. Twelve (71\%) cases had a history of measles-like illness; all 12 had illness prior to 15 months of age. Eight (67\%) children were exposed to measles in California. SSPE was diagnosed at a median age of 12 years (3-35 years), with a latency period of 9.5 years (2.5-34 years). Among measles cases reported to CDPH during 1988-1991, the incidence of SSPE was 1:1367 for children {$<$}5 years, and 1:609 for children {$<$}12 months at time of measles disease. CONCLUSIONS: SSPE cases in California occurred at a high rate among unvaccinated children, particularly those infected during infancy. Protection of unvaccinated infants requires avoidance of travel to endemic areas, or early vaccination prior to travel at age 6-11 months. Clinicians should be aware of SSPE in patients with compatible symptoms, even in older patients with no specific history of measles infection. SSPE demonstrates the high human cost of "natural" measles immunity.},

While the high-coverage afforded can be used, in principle, to identify very rare variants in a population, existing ad hoc approaches frequently fail to distinguish true variants from sequencing errors. We report a method (LoFreq) that models sequencing run-specific error rates to accurately call variants occurring in {$<$}0.05\% of a population. Using simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human), we show that LoFreq has near-perfect specificity, with significantly improved sensitivity compared with existing methods and can efficiently analyze deep Illumina sequencing datasets without resorting to approximations or heuristics. We also present experimental validation for LoFreq on two different platforms (Fluidigm and Sequenom) and its application to call rare somatic variants from exome sequencing datasets for gastric cancer.

The genes of both substrains shared a large number of uridine (U) to cytidine (C) transitions, but the latter contained numerous additional U to C changes in a localized region. Over 90\% of the additional mutations were identical to the hypermutated nucleotides in the M gene found in a measles inclusion body encephalitis case. The nonrandom nature, the apparent host dependency, and the abrupt boundaries of these mutations suggest that these mutations might be caused by an extrinsic biased mutational activity rather than intrinsic polymerase errors. This mutational activity might account for the extraordinarily high C to U ratios in the non-protein-coding regions of both the M and fusion genes of wild-type measles virus.},

We review recent progress in understanding how and why influenza viruses evolve within human hosts. Advances in deep sequencing make it possible to measure within-host genetic diversity in both acute and chronic influenza infections. Factors like antigenic selection, antiviral treatment, tissue specificity, spatial structure, and multiplicity of infection may affect how influenza viruses evolve within human hosts. Studies of within-host evolution can contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary and epidemiological factors that shape influenza virus's global evolution.},

We develop software that can use deep mutational scanning data to infer these properties for polyclonal antibody mixtures. We validate this software using a computationally simulated deep mutational scanning experiment and demonstrate that it enables the prediction of escape by arbitrary combinations of mutations.

The package allows colouring and annotation of a tree by numerical/categorical node attributes, manipulating a tree by rotating, collapsing and zooming out clades, highlighting user selected clades or operational taxonomic units and exploration of a large tree by zooming into a selected portion. A two-dimensional tree can be drawn by scaling the tree width based on an attribute of the nodes. A tree can be annotated with an associated numerical matrix (as a heat map), multiple sequence alignment, subplots or silhouette images. The package ggtree is released under the artistic-2.0 license.

These bottlenecks will affect the maintenance of genetic variation in a virus population and the prevalence of mixed-strain infections, thereby ultimately determining the strength with which different random forces act during evolution. Here we consider different approaches for estimating bottleneck sizes and weigh their merits. We then review quantitative estimates of bottleneck size during cellular infection, within-host spread, horizontal transmission, and finally vertical transmission. In most cases we find that bottlenecks do regularly occur, although in many cases they appear to be virion-concentration dependent. Finally, we consider the evolutionary implications of genetic bottlenecks during virus infection. Although on average strong bottlenecks will lead to declines in fitness, we consider a number of scenarios in which bottlenecks could also be advantageous for viruses.},
