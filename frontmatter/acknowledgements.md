Joining Fred Hutch was the best decision I made in my academic career. I never cease to be amazed by its kind and supportive community, and I feel genuinely proud to be a member of it. The lessons I’ve learned here, both academically and personally, will never leave me.

Spring 2020 proved to be an exceptionally chaotic time to join a lab, particularly one that studies viruses. At the time, I knew nothing about virology and *almost* nothing about programming. Nevertheless, I embarked on a research project that blended both of these topics. I'm beyond grateful to Jesse for offering the perfect balance of support and autonomy. Under Jesse's guidance, I gained the skills that made the work in this dissertation possible. The breadth of topics covered here is a testament to Jesse’s willingness to let his trainees follow their interests.

Like many, my graduate career was marked by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Being stuck at home for a year and a half was an isolating and challenging experience that taught me the importance of having a community of people around me. I’m incredibly thankful to Jesse for being supportive and accommodating during this difficult time.

When I was finally able to come to the lab in person, I was thrilled to join such a wonderful group of people. To my friends in the Bloom lab, you filled every day with joy. There's a reason that I rarely miss a Bloom lab lunch. Our wild discussions and frequent laughter are something I don't take for granted.

Andrew Butler, my office buddy, thank you for being a sounding board for my ideas, my questions, and my (*not so*) occasional hot take. Our brainstorming sessions, while seldom fruitful (except, of course, for VizGenie), have been a real highlight of graduate school.

I'm immensely grateful to my mentors, past and present. Andy Tran, you taught me the importance of humor when things get tough. Christina Fitzimmons and Pedro Batista, you took me under your wings and gave me the confidence to tackle hard problems. Gavin Ha, you took a chance on me and jump-started my journey into computational biology. Finally, Alison Feder, your patience, mentorship, and generosity have been a fundamental part of my graduate education. A great deal of the work in this dissertation was only possible because of your support.

Without a doubt, the most rewarding part of the past four years was the lifelong friendships that I made. Darren, Mark, Richard, Pam, and Miya – graduate school would have been a vastly different experience without our adventures and misadventures.

Justin, your annual sabbatical to Seattle gave me something to look forward to every year. Planning our overly ambitious journeys into the wilderness carried me through some of my most difficult moments.

To my family, your support from many miles away, especially through our regular Zoom calls, has kept me grounded. The love and encouragement you provided, even from afar, have been a steady source of strength.

Grace, your belief in me is my foundation. There is no way I could've done this without you.
