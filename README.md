# Thesis

Author: **Will Hannon**

## Resources

The guidelines for writing a these are [here](https://grad.uw.edu/for-students-and-post-docs/thesisdissertation/). Generally, there aren't many specific formatting requirements for a thesis. There are only _three_ required pages at the beginning of the Thesis:

1. Title Page
2. Abstract
3. Copyright Page

Aside from these three pages, the best way to figure out how to write the thesis is by looking at examples.

### Examples
