# Thesis

Author: **Will Hannon**

## Resources

The guidelines for writing a these are [here](https://grad.uw.edu/for-students-and-post-docs/thesisdissertation/). Generally, there aren't many specific formatting requirements for a thesis. There are only _three_ required pages at the beginning of the Thesis:

0. Copyright Page
1. Title Page
2. Abstract

Aside from these three pages, the best way to figure out how to write the thesis is by looking at examples.

### Examples

Here are some examples from current and former members of the Bloom lab.

#### Postdocs

    > Fancy typsetting with LaTeX
- [Tal Einav](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/11726/1/einav_tal_2019_thesis.pdf)
    > Good abstract and gorgeous typsetting

#### Former Students

## Outline

### 1. Copyright Page

William Hannon, 2023

### 2. Title

Leveraging computational approaches to study virus evolution

### 3. Abstract

*Introduce the general theme of my graduate study. Then, go into individual components and how they're tied together. The length will probably be 1/2 to 1 full page. There will should be around 5 short paragraphs.*

### 4. Awknowledgements

1. Jesse Bloom
2. Alison Feder
3. Andrew Butler
4. Sarah Hilton and the rest of the lab
5. Mark, Maia, Darren, Willy, Richard, and Pam
6. Justin
7. Family (Mom, Pa, Aunt, Uncle, Luc, Claire)
8. Grace

### 5. Introduction

Chapter 0 will be the introduction. I'll go into detail on each of the major topic covered in chapters 1-3.

### 6. Intrahost viral variation and bottlenecks

Chapter 1 will be my work on intrahost viral evolution and bottlenecks.

### 7. Measles SSPE and phylogeography

Chapter 2 will transition into intrahost evolution and the spatial-temporal dynamics of a chronic infection.

### 8. Visualization tools

Chapter 3 will be about `dms-viz` and developing tools for biologists.

### 9. Conclusion (and Future Directions)

Chapter 4 will give a brief synopysis of each of the major topics that I worked on. I'll also introduce some of the things I think will be very important in the future.
